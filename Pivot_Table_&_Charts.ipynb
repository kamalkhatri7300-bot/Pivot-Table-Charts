        "A PivotTable is a powerful tool used to calculate, summarize, and analyze large datasets. It allows you to see comparisons, patterns, and trends in your data without using complex formulas. In this dataset, it helps us quickly see totals (like Sales) grouped by categories (like Region or Product).\n",
